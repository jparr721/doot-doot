# Docker Magic

This file contains my docker images for team use or personal use. 

This should be platform agnostic, but I'm still new so I really don't know.

## Steps to use this code:

- DO NOT clone this repo then try and run these docker images. It'll be a pain in the ass, I promise.
- Instead, you need to copy the docker image (ex. slim) over to a directory that you want.
- Then run ```docker-compose up``` And watch the magic happen right before your eyes.
- If you want any environments set up let me know!
